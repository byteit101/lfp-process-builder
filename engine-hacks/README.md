# EngineHacks Library

Ruby Engine-specific extensions to enable SubSpawn.

## Installation

For most users, install one the other SubSpawn gems directly instead.

Otherwise, install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add engine-hacks

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install engine-hacks

## Usage

For most users, use one of the other SubSpawn API's directly. 

```rb
require 'engine-hacks'
```

An RBS file exists for this gem.

## Development

See parent SubSpawn readme
